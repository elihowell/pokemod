# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Pokemon Trainer Team Changes

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Edit a Pokemon  Trainer team.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I'm going to attempt to read the code of a GBA Pokemon (likely emerald) game and figure out how to modify the code to change a trainers team and potentially sprites/movesets of various pokemon.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will change an existing trainer's team for an early fight.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I would like to attempt to create my own movesets for the Pokemon and change the trainer's text that I'm versing.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Ideally, I am able to create a new sprite for a Pokemon of my own and implement it into a fight.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to grow more comfortable with GBA modding systems and tools. I currently cannot read what anything means and have very very minimal experience with emulation at all. I plan to watch a few hours of youtube videos to understand the basics of editing files and codes of the games as well as learnign how to correctly downloand and format sprites, text, etc. I will be doing it myself.
