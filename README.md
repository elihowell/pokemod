# Pokemon Game Modification

## Overview

This repository contains modifications to a Pokemon game, altering starters and wild encounters. Changes were made via hex editing using HxD and with assistance from the Universal Pokemon Randomizer.

## Challenges Faced

Throughout the project, challenges were encountered in modifying the game data directly and in understanding the structure of the ROM file. However, by using tools like HxD and the Universal Pokemon Randomizer, these obstacles were navigated. I originally wanted to change an opposing trainers' team but struggled to find information on the hex data of specific trainers. I decided to switch gears to altering my own encounters and starter Pokemon. I successfully altered the starter Pokemon of the game myself but used The Universal Pokemon Randomizer to edit and randomize the moves, wild encounters, and trainers in the game.

## Learning Experience

I learned how to successfully run and emulate console games on my computer as well as how to modify them myself. I have gained a decent understanding of what code and data can look like when used practically and am proud of the work I made.
